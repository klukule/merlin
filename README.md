### How it works

The code inside the Albion folder is a .NET solution. The main projects there are:
* Merlin.API: project that contains some code from a decompiled version of the real game code (Albion)
* Merlin: project that contains all the "bot logic" (it uses the Merlin.API project for that). As the game was built using the [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com/pt) the bot code it's nothing than Unity code and C#. 

So when you compile this solution (described below) a `Merlin.dll` is generated (containing the bot logic). The next step is to inject this code inside the game process. This is made using the `injector.exe` (also provided in the repo). The `injector.exe` is a compiled program that uses of the [MInject project](https://github.com/EquiFox/MInject) (a mono injection library).

### Development Requirements (compile yourself):

 * Visual Studio 2017
 * .NET Framework 3.5
 * Windows 7 or above
 * Injector? There one provided in this github.
 * DLLs from Albion Online (we do not provide them)
